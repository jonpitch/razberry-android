razberry-android
==============

An Android app for the Razberry project.

# Prerequisite

A running RaZberry controller, see http://razberry.z-wave.me/ for more information. For additional information on setting up a Rasberry Pi, refer to my blog post at: http://jonpitcherella.com/2013/07/building-a-mean-pi/ (Just the Pi section is sufficient, ignore the Mongo, Express and Angular stuff).

# Getting Started

* git clone
* gradle
* Run on device / emulator

# Supported devices

I only have access to three ZWave devices (two binary switch devices and a dimmer), so the application only has those types.
